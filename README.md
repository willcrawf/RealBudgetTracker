#### Made by Will Crawford


## Background: 
As a college student, one of my biggest problems is money. I am always broke! I know there are plenty of budget and financial apps out there, but I really wanted to make an app that would have every feature. In turn, maybe I could learn some finance, budget, and saving skills.

## Technologies Used:
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* Express
* MongoDB/Mongoose
* Nodemon


## Getting Started:
To get started, you must first log in and set a budget and account information. Then, add a budget item/sub item. 

## User Stories:
* As a user, I want to see my upcoming payments sorted by date in an organized list.
* As a user, I want to see my most spent categories.
* As a user, I want to see all my subs sorted by price with payment dates.
* As a user, I want to be able to adjust my budget.
* As a user, I want my budget to change as I add items.
* As a user, I want to be able to add upcoming payments.
* As a user, I want all months spending in an organized list by date which takes away from the total balance.
* As a user, I want to be able to connect my bank account for automatic debits.
* As a user, I want to be able to see my investments and how they are doing as well as graphs and profit/loss information.
* As a user, I would want a savings tab that displays the balance of my savings account.
* As a user, I want my budget information to be tied to only me and for other users to not be able to view them.

## Stretch Goals:
* Add Investments (Stock, Bitcoin, etc)
* Be able to link with bank account (possibly?)
* Add color conditionals
* Add homepage that shows important info (low balance, upcoming payments, etc)
* Add a fiancial tip of the day API?
* Progress towards what I am saving for via progress bar.
